# `pyannote.audio` speaker diarization toolkit

`pyannote.audio` is an open-source toolkit written in Python for speaker diarization. Based on [PyTorch](pytorch.org) machine learning framework, it comes with state-of-the-art [pretrained models and pipelines](https://hf.co/pyannote), that can be further finetuned to your own data for even better performance.

## TL;DR

1. Install [`pyannote.audio`](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) `3.1` with `pip install pyannote.audio`
2. Accept [`pyannote/segmentation-3.0`](https://hf.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) user conditions
3. Accept [`pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1`](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) user conditions
4. Create access token at [`hf.co/settings/tokens`](https://hf.co/settings/tokens).


```python
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained(
    "pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1",
    use_auth_token="HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")

# send pipeline to GPU (when available)
import torch
pipeline.to(torch.device("cuda"))

# apply pretrained pipeline
diarization = pipeline("audio.wav")

# print the result
for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
    print(f"start={turn.start:.1f}s stop={turn.end:.1f}s speaker_{speaker}")
# start=0.2s stop=1.5s speaker_0
# start=1.8s stop=3.9s speaker_1
# start=4.2s stop=5.7s speaker_0
# ...
```

## Benchmark

Out of the box, `pyannote.audio` speaker diarization [pipeline](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) v3.1 is expected to be much better (and faster) than v2.x.  
Those numbers are diarization error rates (in %):
